IGNORE WARNINGS ABOUT CIRCULAR REFERENCES. This just means "total" and "other" will not be accurate until you set one of them to a value (make one not a formula)
Insert more columns before "other" and after "total" as needed
"total" may be computed as the sum of columns to the right of "total" to "other"
OR "other" may be computed by specifying "total" and subtracting out the columns between the two
